    - Add projects as a list - name, pictures, short description in one line
    - Also add an arrow, which when clicked, expands the project info
    - Add animation for the expansion (GSAP?)
- Add blog PLACEHOLDER
- Add on Home page:
    - Github
    - Projects
    - Blog
    - Experience/Timeline
